I made a small web app called "Tour Me" to post our journeys and trips. (Something like a small blog). Anyone can look at the posts even if they aren't registered on the site. If someone wants to share their own posts they have to make an account by registering. If someone posted a post on the site that specific post only can be edited(updated) or deleted by themselves(Authorization enabled). and last but not least I am planning to add more features ðŸ˜€


I have used Angular for Frontend, NodeJs with ExpressJs for the Backend, and MongoDB for the database. and for the authentication parts have used Jason Web tokens (JWT) With an auto expiration time of 1 hour. (Planning to add more features)
